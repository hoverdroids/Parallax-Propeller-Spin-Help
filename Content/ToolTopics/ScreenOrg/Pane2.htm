        <p class="PlainText"><b>Pane 2: the Recent Folders field and the Folder List.</b>&#160; These two components work together to provide navigational access to the disk drives available to your computer.&#160; The Folder List displays a hierarchical view of folders within each disk drive and can be manipulated in a similar fashion as the left pane of Windows<sup>®</sup> Explorer.&#160; </p>
        <p class="PlainText">The Recent Folders field (above the Folder List) provides a drop-down list of special folders as well as the most recent folders you’ve loaded files from.&#160; Selecting a folder from the Recent Folders field causes the Folder List to immediately navigate to that folder.&#160; In addition, if you select a folder in the Folder List which exists in the Recent Folders list, the Recent Folder field will automatically update itself to display that item.&#160; The Recent Folders list begins with folders of example objects that are included by the Propeller Tool installer.</p>
        <p class="PlainText">If you select a folder that is not in the Recent Folders list, the Recent Folder field will be blank.&#160; The button to the left of the Recent Folders field toggles the function of both the Recent Folders and Folder List between: 1) showing every drive and folder, and 2) showing only drives and folders recently used.&#160; Setting the mode to show recent folders only is a convenient way to quickly navigate to commonly used Propeller Project folders among a large set of unrelated folders on a particular drive or network.</p>
